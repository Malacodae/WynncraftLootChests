# WynncraftLootChests

<p>WynncraftLootChest aims to simplify for the Wynntils users the discovery of loot chests.</p>

> #### How it works
> <p>Wynntils mod for Wynncraft has a configuration file. Inside of it, all the waypoints you create are stored. By default, Wynntils automatically creates a new waypoint when you open a Tier 3 or higher loot chest.</p>
> <p>WynncraftLootChests is a bunch of javascript code you can run locally on your computer to quickly access and update the loot chests stored in your Wynntils configuration file.</p>
> <p>If you don't know what Wynntils is, check this(https://wynntils.com/) website.</p>

### Getting started

- Log in to Wynncraft using Wynntils and create a custom waypoint if you don't have one already. A custom configuration file will be created;
- Navigate to your minecraft folder and search for <code>wynntils/config/</code> folder;
- Make a copy of your Wynntils configuration file

As of now, the list of loot chests is not complete and I invite you to contribute to this project by sharing your Wynntils configuration file.
