# WynncraftLootChests

WynncraftLootChest aims to simplify for the Wynntils users the discovery of loot chests.

> ##### How it works:
> <p>Wynntils mod for Wynncraft has a configuration file. Inside of it, all the waypoints you create are stored. By default, Wynntils automatically creates a new waypoint when you open a Tier 3 or higher loot chest.</p>
> <p>WynncraftLootChests is a bunch of javascript code you can run locally on your computer to quickly access and update the loot chests stored in your Wynntils configuration file.</p>

As of now, the list of loot chests is not complete and I invite you to contribute to this project by sharing your Wynntils configuration file.
