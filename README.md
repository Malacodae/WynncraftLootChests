# WynncraftLootChests

<p>WynncraftLootChest aims to simplify for the Wynntils users the discovery of loot chests.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: As of now, the list of loot chests is not complete and I invite you to contribute to this project by sharing your Wynntils configuration file.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

- Wynntils mod (for Minecraft 1.12.2 or newer);
- Access to the internet;
- Access to a decent web browser.


<h3>Features</h3>

- **List all your loot chest waypoints** with a bunch of information (tier, location, closest Wynncraft place and its level);
- **Compare your loot chest waypoints** with a 2023 updated list of 1000+ loot chests found by me;
- **Automatically add to your Wynntils configuration file the missing loot chests**;


<h3>How it works</h3>

> <p>Wynntils mod for Wynncraft has a configuration file. Inside of it, all the waypoints you create are stored. By default, Wynntils automatically creates a new waypoint when you open a Tier 3 or higher loot chest.</p>
> <p>WynncraftLootChests is a bunch of javascript code you can run locally on your computer to quickly access and update the loot chests stored in your Wynntils configuration file.</p>
> <p>If you don't know what Wynntils is, check https://wynntils.com/).</p>


<h3>Getting started</h3>

- __one time for all__ Log in to Wynncraft using Wynntils and create a custom waypoint if you don't have one already. A custom configuration file will be created;
- Navigate to your minecraft folder and search for <code>wynntils/config/</code> folder;
- You will find two <code>json</code> files: make a copy of your custom Wynntils configuration file (the file that has a complex name);
- Upload your custom Wynntils configuration file somewhere online in order to be accessible through a link (example: https://github.com/);
- Download this repositery on your computer;
- In your downloaded repositery, open <code>index.html</code> using a web browser (I tested it on Chrome and it works fine);
- You will be prompted to put the link to your configuration file, follow the steps to download your updated configuration file;
- CLOSE MINECRAFT if not already closed, keep it closed until the end of the procedure;
- RENAME the downloaded file as the configuration file that you found in <code>wynntils/config/</code> folder and replace it (just for good measure keep a backup on your computer of the original configuration file);
- Enjoy!


<h3>FAQ</h3>

- **Why do I need to upload online my Wynntils configuration file?** Javascript will not allow you to fetch data from a json file stored locally because of CORS and origin security issues from the web browser. If you find an elegant solution to avoid that let me know!
- **I downloaded my updated configuration file generated by WynncraftLootChests, what now?** Replace your configuration file inside your <code>wynntils/config</code> folder while Minecraft is closed. Just take the precaution to save a backup of your original configuration file in case something went wrong.
- **How can I contribute to WynncraftLootChests project?** If your configuration file contains some loot chest waypoints that were not on the list I have and you are sure that those loot chests exists, you can submit your configuration file to me via Discord at <code>Malacodae#0055</code>. In addition to your help, I will add your Minecraft nickname to the list of contributors.
- **How do I automatically create a new waypoint for tier 1 and 2 loot chests?** In-game, go to Wynntils settings.
