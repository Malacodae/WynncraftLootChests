# WynncraftLootChests

<p>WynncraftLootChest aims to simplify for the Wynntils users the discovery of loot chests.</p>
<p class="color:orange;">**As of now, the list of loot chests is not complete and I invite you to contribute to this project by sharing your Wynntils configuration file.**</p>


<h3>Requirements</h3>

- Wynntils mod (for Minecraft 1.12.2 or newer);
- Access to the internet;
- Access to a decent web browser.


<h3>Features</h3>

- **List all your loot chest waypoints** with a bunch of information (tier, location, closest Wynncraft place and its level);
- **Compare your loot chest waypoints** with a 2023 updated list of 1000+ loot chests found by me;
- **Automatically add to your Wynntils configuration file the missing loot chests**;


<h3>How it works</h3>

> <p>Wynntils mod for Wynncraft has a configuration file. Inside of it, all the waypoints you create are stored. By default, Wynntils automatically creates a new waypoint when you open a Tier 3 or higher loot chest.</p>
> <p>WynncraftLootChests is a bunch of javascript code you can run locally on your computer to quickly access and update the loot chests stored in your Wynntils configuration file.</p>
> <p>If you don't know what Wynntils is, check https://wynntils.com/).</p>


<h3>Getting started</h3>

- __one time for all__ Log in to Wynncraft using Wynntils and create a custom waypoint if you don't have one already. A custom configuration file will be created;
- Navigate to your minecraft folder and search for <code>wynntils/config/</code> folder;
- You will find two <code>json</code> files: make a copy of your custom Wynntils configuration file (the file that has a complex name);
- Upload your custom Wynntils configuration file somewhere online in order to be accessible through a link (example: https://github.com/);
- Download this repositery on your computer;
- In your downloaded repositery, open <code>index.html</code> using a web browser (I tested it on Chrome and it works fine);
- You will be prompted to put the link to your configuration file;
- Enjoy!
